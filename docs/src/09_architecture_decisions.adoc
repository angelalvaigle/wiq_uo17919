== Architecture Decisions

This section describes the architecture decisions that were made during the development of the project.

=== Technology Decisions:

**- Decision 1: Use of Microservices**: 
The system is designed as a set of microservices, each responsible for a specific domain or functionality. This architecture allows for better scalability, maintainability, and flexibility.

**- Decision 2: Use of node.js for Backend Services**: 
The backend services of the system are built using node.js, a JavaScript runtime. Node.js was chosen for its performance, scalability, and ease of use.

**- Decision 3: Use of a NoSQL Database**: 
A NoSQL database was chosen for the system due to its flexibility and scalability. The system uses MongoDB as its primary database.

**- Decision 4: Use of a React Frontend**: 
The frontend of the system is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React was chosen for its performance, flexibility, and ease of use.

**- Decision 5: Use of Docker Containers**: 
The system is deployed using Docker containers. This architecture allows for better portability, scalability, and isolation of services.

**- Decision 6: Use of a RESTful API**: 
The system exposes a RESTful API for communication between the frontend and the microservices. This architecture allows for better decoupling between the frontend and backend components.
