=== Whitebox of the Overall System 
[plantuml, "whitebox_overall_system", svg]
----
actor user
component wiq as "wiq"
component wikidata as "wikidata"

user -right-> wiq: interacts
wiq <-right-> wikidata: queries
----

Motivation::
WIQ is a web application where users can register and start playing. The game consists of answering a series of questions of various types and topics, with a reward for each correct answer. An important aspect of the system is that the questions will be automatically generated from Wikidata data (https://www.wikidata.org/).
