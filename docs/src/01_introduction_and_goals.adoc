== Introduction and Goals

Saber y Ganar is the Software Architecture project developed by Ángel Luis Álvarez Iglesias (uo17919), under the supervision of Jorge Álvarez Fidalgo.

This project consists of an application that features a question-and-answer game, designed to be both engaging and educational. Additionally, the application offers a statistics tracking system, allowing registered users to view their own performance metrics and compare them with those of other players.

The application is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB for the database, Express.js for the server-side framework, React for the front-end development, and Node.js for the runtime environment.
